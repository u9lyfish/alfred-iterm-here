# alfred-iterm-here
A simple [Alfred 2](http://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow that opens a iTerm2 terminal in frontmost Finder window's directory in [iTerm2 Hotkey Window](https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-one-page.html#documentation-highlights.html). If no Finder window is open, the Terminal opens in the user's home directory.
